Core design thinking:
	Composite patterns
		
help:
	-i(interface) : the name of network interface, such as -i eth0, catch the packet of eth0

	-p(protocol) : set protocol filter, such as -p tcp, view the tcp packet

	-g(Gui) : use the gui view, ps: the app ./netsniffer and ./NetSnifferGui must in the same dir
